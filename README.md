### CDAB-HQ

Hi im from Colombia, my name is **C**arlos **D**aniel **A**lzate **B**otero, for that my Username **CDAB-HQ**  is the first letter in every name, and lastname
**HQ** meaning Headquarter, Im a student in the university, i study development software, with 25 years old, iÂ´m learning basic things such as 
- Terminal
- Git and GitHub
- NPM, yarn or another
i take the path learning of full stack development, regardless of the branchs of all software there, i think that **Software** is anything, dont care else a simple WebPage, small androidGame, or a basic desktop app made in c# or java with a basic UI, all of thins is software i not shall be understimated.

A few mounts i suffer existencial crisis for the realease of chatGPT or any IA prompt, i never self-lie, since the concept of IA, i know that reemplace my skills on Programming before another psysical work, but Â¿what is Programming? when i learn programming at 2019, i thought that is the end of all software art, i can creat, design and solve alghoritms for especific problems, but i never knows how to create the app, or largest programms like the profesional apps of Microsoft, or any app android can solve real problems, in another words, with the only skill of Programming is like as hit the wall with a hammer, Programming is the action of to hammer, but not building the House, But no Building the app.

Then i find to build the house, build the app, not to hammer, not to programming.

Also i thinking that the software is not the end obviosly, but i say, such a sandwich, the software is only the Bread, in the content of the Sandwich there All Humanity Knowledge like a Music, Science, Religion, Art, Medicine, Management, etc, the list is largest, Software is only the tool, a bridge, this is a important thing that is easy to forget, i say Obviosly.
